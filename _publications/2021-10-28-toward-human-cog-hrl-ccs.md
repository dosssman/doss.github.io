title: "Toward Human Cognition-inspired High-Level Decision Making For Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Agents"
excerpt: "Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) methods aim to leverage the concept of temporal abstraction to efficiently solve long-horizon, sequential decision-making problems with sparse and delayed rewards. However, the decision-making process of the agent in most HRL methods is often based directly on low-level observations, while also using fixed temporal abstraction. We propose the hierarchical world model (HWM), which can capture more flexible high-level, temporally abstract dynamics, as well as low-level dynamics of the system.
We posit such model is a natural extension to the HRL framework toward a decision-making process closer to that of humans."
