# Short version

This write up will focus on the points and showcasing the final result.

## Specs
__Model__: Charybdis __TODO__: Link to offical website
- Case: 3D Printed with Formalabs 3B, Clear Resin v4, Custom Engraving
- Switches Khail Pro Purple x 58 (__TODO__ Double check the count)
- Keycaps: DSA Blank Transluescent cases
- Other: Trackbball, RGB backlight key switch hot-swapping, Elite-C microcontroller (MCU) socketing


__TODO__: Emphasize the benefits / caveats of Charybdis in general, then relatively to the ErgoDash. Probably put it in the long version.

## Benefits
- The abandon of the staggered key layout toward _columnar_ or _staggered ortholiner_ (such as ErgoDash) is a net positive. Charybdis brings this aspect one step further by adding depths to match the length of each finger.
- Split keyboard allows for healhier and more comfortable posture.
- Thumb cluster leverages the thumb for better efficiency.
- The trackball, combined with reduced key number and the leverage of layers drastically reduces hand movement, thus further improving comfort and efficiency.
- Frees up some real estate on the desk, makes it more flexible.
- The use of tenting greatly reduces pronation and the pain associated with it, further improving comfort and efficiency.
- Freedom to customize the keyboard layout to fit specific use case, which can bring non-negligible quality of life improvements.

## Caveats
- Pricey
- Requires some technical skill (electronics assembly and soldering, diagnosing asembly problem, etc...). Compared to ErgoDash, the Charybdis has a higher difficulty namely due to trackball support, and flexible PCB mounting.
- For someone that has gotten used to standard _staggered_ keybaord layouts, a learning curve for the improved layout. This barely passes as a caveats, as the comfort of using an ergonomic keyboard vastly makes up for it.
- _Once you try it, you will never want to come back_. In case one has to work at different physical locations, the high price and time investment makes having duplicate configuration prohibitive. While proficiency with standard keyboard will hardly bbe affected, it becomes very unpleasant to do so, which in my personal case, would lead to rants and bout of annoying _ergo keyboard master race elitism_ that can annoy other people. Using laptop keyboards also becomes an unpleasant activity.

# Build notes

## Motivation

- The ErgoDash was a solid entry as a first build of an ergonomic mech. keyboard.
- As soon as the ErgoDash build was finished however, it became clear that there was still some room for improvement regarding the ergonomics. One of the crucial challenge was the persistent need to move the hand away from the keybaord to the mouse. Although I managed to find a compromise by using a trackball slid under the tented right side of the keyboard, a more _compact_ keyboard was more appealing.

## Part List

- Describe the sourcing of the components, and aspect to think of while ordering the parts and laying the conceptual design for the keyboard

## Building steps

__TODO__: Forget not the disclainer that this is not an official build order, but just the commitment of my build experince.
Also insist on the difference with the standard build: hot-swapping, elite-c socketing, custom 3d pritning and engraving.

### 1. 3D printing

## Key layout and firmware 

- Expand on the rational behind the layout design
- Add the steps for flashing.
__NOTE / TODO__ By this point, you should have already cloned the bkb-master branch, consolidated the qmk firmware under a single repository for both j0554 and dosssman, and describe the clean process of installing it.
