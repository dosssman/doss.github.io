**TODO** Get some pictures with the tentings on.

## Specifications

**Model:** [Charybdis 4x6](https://bastardkb.com/charybdis/)

**Case:**: 3D printed with Formlabs 3, Clear Resin v4, and custom embossed STL files [Left]() [Right]() (**TODO** Add link to section)

**Switches:**: Kaihl Pro Purple x 56

**Keycaps:** Blank transluescent DSA key caps mix

**Other:**
- Clear case
- Trackball with 3D printed BTU instead of the default bearings **TODO: Add links**
- RGB key back-light
- Hot-swappable key switches
- Socketed Elite-C micro-controller (MCU)

## Benefits

- Departing from the tradditional staggered key layout toward _columnar_ or _staggered ortholinear_ (such as ErgoDash too) is a net positive. Charybdis brings this aspect one step further by adding depths to match the different lengths of each finger.
- Split and tented keyboard allows for healthier and more comfortable posture. Namely, pronation of the forearms is reduced thanks to the tenting that makes the board more *vertical*. Meanwhile, having a split keyboard let's you keep the back straight, the chest out and the arms wide and stretched, which should be a more natural position overall. [More intuitive explanation on the benefits here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TCbc9oB1E&ab_channel=ShortCircuit).
- The thumb, criminally underused on traditional keyboards is empowered with thumb key clusters, increasing typing efficiency.
- Frees up some real estate on the desk, makes it more flexible.
- Freedom to customize the keyboard layout to fit one's specific needs, which can bring non-negligible quality of life improvements.
- Compared to the previous [ErgoDash build](/projects/2020-08-ergodash-build/), Charybdis' trackball combined with an even more reduced key count and the leverage of layers drastically reduces hand movement, thus further improving comfort and efficiency, while sporting a compact form factor.
- **[Build specific]** Hot-swappable switches makes it easy to change a broken switch later without having to pull out the soldering iron. On this build, however, the top and bottom rows' switches will likely require unscrewing the bottom plate of the case to hold the flexible PCB while swapping the switches.
- **[Build specific]** Socketed Elite-C micro-controller further increase the modularity of this build. This essentially removes the worries about having the Elite-C properly aligned with the case when soldering it to the PCB shield. More importantly, it will allow for a quicker and relatively painless replacement or fix when needs be (For example, the USB port on the micro-controller side can break due after a few thousand plug-in plug-outs. This happened with the [previous build](/projects/2020-08-ergodash-build/), albeit with a weaker, Pro Micro controller).

## Caveats

- Pricey. With a base price of around 400\\$ (probably), it can go higher depending on the kind of components one decides to use. This specific builds amount to 720\\$, and that is without accounting for the 3D printing machine used to print the case, and the soldering tools.
- Requires some technical skill (electronics assembly and soldering, diagnosing assembly problem, etc...). Compared to the ErgoDash, the Charybdis has a higher difficulty namely due to the presence of a trackball and flexible PCB mounting (especially if doing a hot-swap key switch build).
- For someone that has gotten used to standard _staggered_ keyboard layouts, there will be some learning curve for the new layout. This barely passes as a caveat, as the comfort of using an ergonomic keyboard vastly makes up for it in the medium to long-term.
- _Once you try it, you will never want to come back_. In case one has to work at different physical locations, the high price and time investment makes having duplicate configuration prohibitive. While proficiency with standard keyboard will hardly be affected, it becomes very unpleasant to use them. In my personal case, having to use a standard case leads to unending rants and bout of annoying _ergo keyboard master race elitism_ that probably annoys the people around. Using laptop keyboards also becomes a similarly unpleasant (and potentially painful) activity.
**TODO**: Insert the "They don't know their keyboard is shit meme ?

## Highlights of the building experience

- When 3D printing your own case, make sure of the orientation of each case and the corresponding tenting and bottom plate.
- To maximize aesthetic of the clear case, the 3D printing supports are better set manually to optimize the polishing process.

**TODO** particularly difficult things related to this build.

- For a clear build, manual positioning of the printing support to optimize the aesthetics might be better than automatically generated.
- When doing a hot-swapper key switches build, depending on how tight the hot-swap sockets are can lead to flexible PCB *sliding off* the key switches' pin.

# Build notes (Long version)

## Motivation

Around two years ago, I entered the world of custom ergonomic keyboards with the [ErgoDash build](/projects/2020-08-ergodash-build/).
While this was decently balanced build in terms of difficulty and features, there was mainly two shortcomings that kept on nagging over the years, slowly building the impetus to move on to the Charybdis.

First, despite its ergonomic nature, there was still a need to move the right hand to reach for the mouse.
Having a workflow that sometimes requires prolonged use of the mouse, this quickly become as source of discomfort.
Second, the tenting solution was not as flexible, nor as high enough as I would have expected to have be optimally comfortable.

Although the two shortcoming above were decently solved by having a [trackball slid just right under the tented right case](/projects/2020-08-ergodash-build/#cons), both components being detached would sometimes make it difficult to move then reposition the keyboard and mouse to the optimal location on the desk.
Furthermore, the trackball would sometimes slid too far under the case, resulting in the latter pushing on the "Previous" or "Next" key of the former. This would result in erratic behavior of the computer especially when using a web browser, as well as the inability to input any character.

The *need* more *compact* design that combined both the ergonomics of the ErgoDash as well as the trackball slowly crept up overtime.
As I was lurking in [r/ErgoMechKeyboards](https://reddit.com/r/ergomechkeyboards) and various ergonomic keyboards websites and discord servers, the Charybdis caught might attention for its convenient sourcing (can order all the necessary part in one go), a further fleshed out *2.5D columnar key layout* that looked much more ergonomical, and an easy to install trackball.
While I originally started the Charybdis build to introduce a lab colleague to DIY ergonomic keyboards, a hands on trial with the finished product was the final impetus toward finally building one for myself.

Also, these few paragraphs are probably more of a justification to myself for spending a non-negligible amount of money, time, and effort to build this board.

## Part List

The following is the list of the various parts and components to source, with an approximate on the price as of May 2022 for reference.
The components to order might vary depending on the degree of customization might desired (different 3D case printing ? different key switches ? with or without hot-swap / micro-controller socketing ? etc...).
But in that case, the following part list should at best serve as a vague reference.

moreover, depending on the builder's geographical location, there might be better offers or method of acquisition for those various parts.

**Notes**
- (Note 1): The case is not included. One might print their own case, or also purchase it directly from the website as a different kit. There is also a "Prebuilt" option.
- (Note 2): General enough products that do not warrant a link ... unless one might be interested in also [DIY-ing the cables](https://www.zapcables.com/).
- (Note 3): Already having some from the previous build, so 100 were enough. Strictly speaking however, one would need to order $56 \times 2$ thus $112$ to have enough for all the keys.
- (Note 4): For the Shield v2, each Elite-C will require $12 + 12 + 5 = 29$ header sockets, and the corresponding 29 pins. 
For the `Shield v1` version, the Elite-C requires $12 + 6$ header sockets, and the same amount of pins.
The headers in the provided link are _12 pins header sockets_ that are sold as a pair. The pins are also sold as a set of $24$, to match the header sockets.
As of 2022-06-14, it seems that the Shield v2 will be the default, so this post will use that one as reference from now on. This will unfortunately cause some surplus when ordering the components for socketing the Elite-Cs, but they can be usd to socke other components, such as the various ribbon cable, and RGB cables.
To save up on the pins, one could also use some LED legs as instead.
- (Note 5): Depending on the geographical location, not only the prices part, but also the import tax, various other taxes, and shipping fees can add up to a non-negligible amount.

## Build log

**DISCLAIMER** This should not be considered as a build guide, but an additional reference with some notes regarding the special cases and problem encountered through the build, that might not be self-evident during the conceptual phase or planning of the keyboard build.
Ultimately, it is more of an attempt to document what worked well during the process, as well as the mistakes made along the way.
{: .notice--danger}

Rigorously, the [**Charybdis**](https://bastardkb.com/charybdis/) refers to the side of the board that holds the trackball, while the other side is a [**Scylla**](https://bastardkb.com/scylla/) board, which does not have a trackball.
In this build, the left side uses the **Scylla** board, while the right side uses the **Charybdis** with the trackball.

__TODO__: Forget not the disclaimer that this is not an official build order, but just the commitment of my build experience.
Also insist on the difference with the standard build: hot-swapping, elite-c socketing, custom 3D printing and engraving.
Also, might be worth mentioning that this build is based on Shield v2, which requires a different install, as well as he proper firmware to be used.

- As it was the first time building such a keyboard, it might be safer to start with the *Scylla* sides that is relatively simpler, owing to the lack of trackball.

### 1. 3D printing the cases [Optional] [Left, Right]

For this build, the clear cases were printed using a FormLabs 3 SLA printer. THe material used was the *Clear v4 Resin*.
The files to 3D print are generously provided on the [official github repository](https://github.com/Bastardkb/charybdis) in the STL format.

In an attempt to have an ever more customized keyboard, I also engraved my nickname using Blender before printing the customized 3D files.
**TODO**: Screenshot of the engraving, engraved files STL link for reference.
{: .text-justify}

Finally, as I planned to heavily rely on the tenting solution, I used the wrist rests open-sourced [here] **TODO: Add links to wrist rest STLs**.
The wrist rests were made a bit taller to match with the tents height, with some manually added infills to save up resin.
{: .text-justify}

Printing with a FormLabs printer requires the STL files to be sliced with the *PreForm* software. 
For this *Crystaldis* build, the aesthetics of the clear case were relatively important. However, the 3D printing process requires support structures that would be spread arbitrarily over the cases, when using the automatic generation option in PreForm.
Then, the supports must then be broken, which unfortunately leaves some small, but hard to miss dots and scratches both in and outside the cases.
While the outside support remain can be polished out fairly easily, the ones in the inner side of the case can pose some challenge.
I ended up manually editing the supports to make the polishing easier. On a side, the automatically generated supports can be overly generous, which ends up costing in resin.
Meanwhile, a more astutely designed support structure not only helped improving the aesthetics, but also reduced the amount of resin used by virtue of having less support.
{: .text-justify}

Another important *sanity check* before printing anything was to make sure of the orientation of the STL files for the case and the tenting.
Namely, at the time I cloned the official [repository]([official github repository](https://github.com/Bastardkb/charybdis)), the case of the Charybdis was set to the left hand by default, which would thus require a mirroring to fit the right-hand side trackball of this build.
{: .text-justify}

I the time of the build, I ended up ultimately really on the following checklist:
{: .text-justify}

- [ ] Scylla Case STL: Is it left hand ?
- [ ] Scylla Tenting STL: Is it left hand ?
- [ ] Scylla Bottom Plate STL: Is it left hand ?
- [ ] Charybdis Case STL: Is it right hand ?
- [ ] Charybdis Tenting STL: is it right hand ?
- [ ] Charybdis Bottom Plate STL: is it right hand ?
- [ ] Charybdis Top Adapter STL: no changes needed
- [ ] Charybdis Bottom Adapter STL: no changes needed
- [ ] Charybdis Sensor Cover STL: no changes needed
- [ ] Charybdis Printable BTU mods: no changes needed
- [ ] Wrist rest STL: right hand check ?
- [ ] Wrist rest STL: left hand check ?

Besides that, here are a few notes regarding printing with a FormLab 3 using the Clear v4 resin:
{: .text-justify}

- Once the print is finished and taken out of the printer, remove the print from the build stage as soon as possible. Otherwise, the ambient UV rays will make the support structure in contact with the build stage solidify, thus making the removal process akin to torture.
- If the aesthetics of the print are important (clear case for example), then manual support editing might not only save up in resin, but make the polishing result more efficient, and the overall product seamlessly transparent. 
- When designing the support structure manually, using mini-raft and **slightly** reduce the density of the support can make the removal process easier. Using smaller *support touch point* of around $0.42$ can also help reduce the pain of the polishing. However, further reducing the touch point size can lead to failure of the prints.
- Curing the prints with UV and heat (using FormLabs Cure) even for a few minutes will make the case yellowish. Fortunately, the printed cases and other components were already solid enough by themselves to skip this step and conserve a more *natural color*.
- For clear prints, polishing then applying some clear UV cut coating is a must. The clear coating improves the glossiness and transparency of the print, as well as protect the case from yellow across time due to ambient UV rays. Before the prints are coated, it would be better to keep them hidden from sun light, or other UV ray sources.

    <figcaption>Freshly 3D printed custom wrist wrest, with manually added infills.</figcaption>
</figure>

A quick note regarding printing such a wrist rest that has infills.
Contrary to what is shown in the three pictures above, it is better to print object that have such kind of holes or infills with the flat part facing the printing state.
Namely, with the wrist rest as above, the removal of the supports after printing is inconvenient, and is bound to leave some traces that would not see well with other mildly OCD fellows.
{: .text-justify}

In subsequent print, it was easier to orient the 3D model with the flat face parallel to the printing stage, and the supports connecting directly to it.
This make the support removal easier, and their traces can be easily polished away.
This also leaves the infill holes nice and clean, without scratches that would happen if the supports were set in those holes instead.

    <figcaption>Preliminary test of the UV Clear coat. Greatly improves the aesthetics of the case.</figcaption>
</figure>

Unline FDM-based (filament) prints, resin prints would require some serious clean up at least.
In this case were the case was printed from a clear / tranparent resin, the post processing not only requires a careful and thorough cleaning, but also polishing, and even coating.
{: .text-justify}

First, the case components were polished using sandpaper of roughness $800$ then $2000$.
Dry polish revealed itself to be quite uncomfortable both to the touch, sight, and the ears (like bad chalk screaching on a blackboard).
_Wet polishing_, on the other hand, allowes for better visibility of the remaining support while polishing, while making the overall process less iritative for the touch and the ears.

There was an attempt at printing custom key caps. While definitely usable, the results are not as good as commercially available alternative.
It might be caused by using the default layer width of $0.1$mm when printing, but there were visible lines that could be felt on the surface of the keys.
While this detail could be polished away, it defeats the purpose if the key cap is expected to have bump to serve as *landmark* for the home row.
The sharp edges of the key caps would usually be botched during the printing too.

### 2. Preparing the case

Once the printed case is all clean and ready for assembly, the next step is to add the _inserts_ for the screws in the appropriate locations.
For this specific clear case, the resin material seems to have a higher melting temperature than FDM-based prints.
Therefore, it requiered setting the iron around $280$ to $300$ degrees Celsius instead.
{: .text-justify}

To be safe, it would be better to still start from 200 as per the guide, then increment the temperature slightly until the inserts can be melt-inserted into the case.
The parts where the MCU shield has to be screwed later are especially fragile, and should be handled with the lowest possible temperature and gentleness during the insert.
